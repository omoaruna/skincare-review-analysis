Beauty Product Review Analyzer
Create a program that processes a collection of beauty product reviews and generates insights. Here's what it should do:

Data Structure: Store product reviews as a list of dictionaries. Each review should have: product name, 
brand, rating (1-5), review text, and reviewer age group.
Core Functions:

Add new reviews
Calculate average rating per product
Find the most/least popular products
Count how many times specific words appear across all reviews (like "moisturizing", 
"lightweight", "greasy")
Filter reviews by rating or age group


Challenge Features (if you want to stretch):

Identify the most positive/negative words used
Group products by brand and compare average ratings
Find products mentioned together in reviews



Start with maybe 10-15 sample reviews you create yourself. This will test your 
skills with dictionaries, lists, loops, functions, string manipulation, and basic
data analysis - all core Python concepts you'll need for data science.
The beauty domain connection also gives you a preview of the kind of text analysis
you'd do in real fashion/beauty ML projects.
